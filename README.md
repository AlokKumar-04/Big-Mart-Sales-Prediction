# Big Mart Sales Prediction

This project aims to predict the sales of products in various Big Mart outlets using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes information about the products and the stores, and the task is to predict the sales for the test dataset.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Loading the training and test datasets.
   - Initial exploration to understand the data distribution and identify missing values.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values and inconsistencies in the data.
   - Feature engineering, including encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing the relationships between different features and the target variable (`Item_Outlet_Sales`).
   - Identifying significant features and correlations.

4. **Model Building and Evaluation**
   - Training a Random Forest model and other regression models.
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared.

5. **Prediction**
   - Generating predictions for the test dataset using the trained model.
   - Exporting the predictions for submission.
